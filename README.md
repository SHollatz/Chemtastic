# giphtastic
App uses GIPHY API https://developers.giphy.com/docs/ to collect online giphs under the topic chemical elements. 

#Purpose
This app can be used for inquiry based learning in chemistry education. The low entry level approach selects random gifs (g rated) that relate to the searched element. These include molecular models, natural appearance,experiments, production processes, areas of usage, etc. Gifs that relate only indirectly to the topic can still be fun and help to memorize names or reflect preconcepts in society. The fastest way to check for proper findings is if the element is stated in the title. If the element is not in the title,the gif maybe misleading.
